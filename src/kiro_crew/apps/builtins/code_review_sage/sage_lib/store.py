"""Code Review Sage — app-local store + self-heal data layout.

This module is the deterministic, token-free backbone of the app. It owns the
on-disk layout under ``<config_dir>/apps/code-review-sage/data/`` (i.e.
``~/.kiro/crew/apps/code-review-sage/data/`` by default) and is safe to run on
every action (idempotent self-heal).

Layout:

    data/
      learnings/
        common/learned-patterns.md          # cross-repo (warm start)
        repos/<host>/<org>/<repo>/
            learned-patterns.md
            checkpoint.json
      results/<change-id>.json               # one result record per change
      reports/index.json                     # latest run pointer (UI reads)
      config.json                            # resolved paths, globs, caps, rule packs

Run ``python3 sage_lib/store.py --ensure`` to create/repair the layout and seed
``config.json`` without overwriting any user edits.
