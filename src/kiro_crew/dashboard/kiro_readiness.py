"""Shared pre-enqueue guard for Kiro-backed dashboard sessions.

Readiness is probed once at gateway start and then only on an explicit user
action (see ``kiro_prerequisite.KiroPrerequisiteService.session_ready``), so the
latched value can be arbitrarily stale. That splits the callers in two:

* **Ordinary sends are UNGATED.** A stale not-ready value must never block a
  send: the real ACP attempt is the authority, and it reports a signed-out CLI as
  an actionable ``AcpAuthRequired`` error in the chat transcript. Blocking on
  latched state was the stuck case — a user who signed in from a terminal stayed
  locked out until something re-probed. These handlers mutate nothing before the
  turn, so a failed turn costs only an error card.
* **Endpoints that act BEFORE the turn still BLOCK**
  (:func:`reject_if_kiro_unverified`) — the poll-driven ``kiro-cli`` spawn sites
  and the destructive reruns. Neither can rely on the ACP attempt as its
  authority: one has no turn at all, the other has already rewritten durable
  history by the time the turn fails. See
  ``docs/system-specs/modules/acp-client.md`` § "Poll-driven spawn sites are
  readiness-gated".

BACKEND SCOPE: every probe behind this latch asks about ``kiro-cli`` — its
binary, its config, its sign-in. When ``agent.acp_backend`` selects a different
adapter, that question is not the one any of these callers need answered, and
the honest answer is "unknown", not "not ready". A ``ready=False`` latch on such
a host is a certainty (nobody signed into kiro-cli, and nothing will), so the
gate would 503 resume, regenerate, rewind and ``/v1/chat/completions`` forever
while ordinary sends — deliberately ungated — kept working. That partial
failure is worse than no gate at all, so the gate opens: the selected adapter's
own auth surfaces as an ``AcpAuthRequired`` error card, and its readiness is
reported up front by ``kirocrew doctor`` instead.

    The latch alone cannot authorize these callers. It is written at boot and

    and every one of this gate's callers acts irreversibly on that answer
    (deletes history, or spawns a browser-opening ``kiro-cli``). "Probe at boot
    only" is the right rule for the send path, which risks nothing; it is the
    wrong rule for authorization.

    Two classes qualify, both because the ACP attempt cannot be their authority:

    * **Poll-driven ``kiro-cli`` spawn sites** (``/api/models``,
      ``/api/sessions/usage``) — they shell out on a timer with no turn to report
      into, and an unauthenticated spawn opens an interactive browser login (and
      ``kiro-cli chat`` hangs) on every poll interval.
    * **Destructive reruns** (regenerate, edit-resend, rewind) — they truncate
      and PERSIST session history *before* the background turn starts, so a
      signed-out install would drop prior turns while returning 200. There is no
      later error card that can undo a durable rewrite, so the check has to
      happen before the mutation.
    * **``POST /v1/chat/completions``** — no transcript the caller reads. Its
      collectors take only ``chunk``/``assistant`` roles, so an ``AcpAuthRequired``
      turn's ``error`` card is invisible and the request would answer 200 with
      empty content, which an SDK client cannot tell apart from a model that said
      nothing.

    Ordinary sends are deliberately NOT gated: they mutate nothing up front, so a
    stale latch must not block them (see the module docstring). A missing or
    invalid service fails closed here.

    These callers must not trust the latch in EITHER direction, so this uses
    :func:`kiro_verified_ready` — a stale ``ready=True`` is as dangerous as a
    stale ``ready=False`` here (it authorizes the history rewrite or the
    browser-opening spawn), and only these paths pay for the re-probe.

    Opens unconditionally when a non-kiro ``agent.acp_backend`` is selected — the
    kiro latch cannot speak for another adapter. See the module docstring
    § BACKEND SCOPE.
