"""Dev Container support: run a session's kiro-cli inside the project's
devcontainer (VS Code parity).

When ``agent.devcontainer`` is ``"auto"`` and a session's work dir carries a
``.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`` (or ``.devcontainer.json``), the ACP spawn
path replaces the host kiro-cli argv with a ``docker exec`` into a container
built by the reference ``@devcontainers/cli`` — the same engine VS Code uses.
The repo's devcontainer.json is honored in full (image/build, features,
lifecycle hooks, mounts, runArgs) after a one-time per-config human trust
grant, mirroring VS Code's Workspace Trust model. The gateway does NOT strip
or override the file: parity, not a sandbox.

Architecture (mirrors VS Code's client/server split):
  - gateway stays on the host (UI plane);
  - kiro-cli is executed INSIDE the container (execution plane), like
    vscode-server. Verified necessary: kiro-cli 2.14 executes shell/file
    tools in-process and ignores the ACP client fs/terminal capabilities,
    so the process itself must move.
  - the workspace is bind-mounted by the devcontainer CLI; the ACP
    ``session/new`` cwd uses the container-side workspace folder.

Trust model: the SHA-256 of the effective devcontainer.json must be granted
by a dashboard user before any build or exec. Config edits invalidate trust
(hash mismatch → re-prompt), matching VS Code's re-prompt on change.

Container reuse: one container per project directory, keyed by an id-label,
reused across sessions and gateway restarts (``devcontainer up`` is
idempotent for an unchanged config).

Known v1 limitations (documented in docs/devcontainers.md):
  - Kiro Crew's own managed MCP servers (mcp-core/cron/computer) are not
    reachable from inside the container (their REST callback targets the
    gateway's host loopback). kiro-cli reports mcp_server_init_failure and
    the session continues with the project toolchain fully functional.
  - /proc-based liveness observes the host-side ``docker exec`` client
    proxy: death detection works (pipe close), wedge heuristics degrade.
  - Linux hosts only. On macOS, Docker Desktop is a VM; the existing
    Seatbelt sandbox path is unchanged.

    Two things this closes:

    * ``initializeCommand`` is the one lifecycle hook the spec runs on the HOST
      ("run on the host machine during initialization"). Honoring it would let
      the project's config execute outside the container entirely, which is the
      one thing the container's existence is supposed to bound. It is stripped
      here, and the build is pointed at this copy via ``--override-config``, so
      the CLI never sees it.
    * The copy is written from the digest-verified bytes and lives under the
      gateway's own keystone-protected dir, so what the CLI parses is what was
      trusted rather than whatever is on disk when the build starts.

    ``--override-config`` relocates ONLY devcontainer.json, so referenced build
    inputs need separate handling, and the two kinds differ in what a mid-build
    swap can actually reach:

    * ``build.dockerfile`` / ``build.context`` still resolve against the
      workspace -- verified by experiment, including with an absolute context --
      so they cannot be relocated. They are instead required to stay inside the
      hashed tree (assert_build_inputs_contained). A swap landing mid-build
      changes only what goes INTO the image, which the agent already controls
      once it has a shell in the container, so the residual is not an escalation.
    * ``dockerComposeFile`` is different in both directions. It resolves against
      the CONFIG FILE's directory rather than the workspace (the CLI's own path
      helper takes ``configFilePath`` as the base, confirmed by a fixture where a
      compose file present ONLY beside the sanitized copy resolved fine), and a
      compose service can request host privilege -- ``privileged``, a bind of
      ``/``, the docker socket. That combination makes it the one referenced
      input worth freezing, and the one that CAN be frozen: the digest-verified
      bytes are copied in beside this config and the reference is rewritten to
      the copy, so a swap during the build is simply not read.
